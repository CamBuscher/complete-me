## Complete Me

My autocomplete functionality, to be used in future projects. Insert words (or huge swaths of them with the populate method), have words suggested to you, delete words from being suggested again, and have suggestions weighted by how many times a word has been chosen. 

This project has no front-end implementation yet, but will be used in my next project, "Weatherly."

For now, here's some tests.
